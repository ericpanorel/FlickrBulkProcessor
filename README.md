# FlickrBulkProcessor
If you decided to quit Flickr, and had already download the zip files (their archive), this [notebook](https://jupyter.org/) attempts to extract the zip files, and organize your photos the way how you did it in Flickr. Note that comments, and tags are not processed in this notebook.

Sure, you can expand it to perform as such.
